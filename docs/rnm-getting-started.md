This guide will help you get started on setting up your very first React Native for macOS app.

>** Latest stable version available for React Native for macOS is 0.75**

For information around how to set up:
- React Native for iOS and Android: See [React Native Getting Started Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- React Native for Windows: See [React Native for Windows Getting Started Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started)

## Install React Native for macOS

Remember to call `react-native init` from the place you want your project directory to live. Be sure to use the same minor version between React Native and React Native macOS. We'll use `^0.71.0`

```
npx react-native@latest init <projectName> --version 0.75.0
```

### Navigate into this newly created directory

Once your project has been initialized, React Native will have created a new sub directory where all your generated files live.

```
cd <projectName>
```

### Install the macOS extension

Install the React Native for macOS packages.

```
npx react-native-macos-init
```

## Running a React Native macOS App

- **Without using Xcode**:
  In your React Native macOS project directory, run:

  ```
  npx react-native run-macos
  ```

- **Using Xcode**:
  Open `macos\test.xcworkspace` in Xcode or run `xed -b macos`; `yarn start`. Hit the Run button.

A new Command Prompt window will open with the React packager as well as a `react-native-macos` app. This step may take a while during first run since it involves building the entire project and all dependencies. You can now start developing! 🎉
