The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout. `View` maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

`View` is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.

This example creates a `View` that wraps two boxes with color and a text component in a row with padding.

```SnackPlayer name=View%20Example
import React from 'react';
import {View, Text} from 'react-native';
import {SafeAreaView, SafeAreaProvider} from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

const ViewBoxesWithColorAndText = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <SafeAreaView style={{height: 100, flexDirection: 'row'}}>
        <View style={{backgroundColor: 'blue', flex: 0.2}} />
        <View style={{backgroundColor: 'red', flex: 0.4}} />
        <Text>Hello World!</Text>
      </SafeAreaView>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
};

export default ViewBoxesWithColorAndText;
```

> `View`s are designed to be used with [`StyleSheet`]() for clarity and performance, although inline styles are also supported.

### Synthetic Touch Events

For `View` responder props (e.g., `onResponderMove`), the synthetic touch event passed to them are in form of [PressEvent]().

# Reference

## Props

---

### `accessibilityActions`

Accessibility actions allow an assistive technology to programmatically invoke the actions of a component. The `accessibilityActions` property should contain a list of action objects. Each action object should contain the field name and label.


| Type  |
| ----- |
| array |

---

### `accessibilityHint`

An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not clear from the accessibility label.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `accessibilityLabel`

Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the `Text` nodes separated by space.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `accessibilityRole`

`accessibilityRole` communicates the purpose of a component to the user of an assistive technology.

`accessibilityRole` can be one of the following:

- `'none'` - Used when the element has no role.
- `'button'` - Used when the element should be treated as a button.
- `'link'` - Used when the element should be treated as a link.
- `'search'` - Used when the text field element should also be treated as a search field.
- `'image'` - Used when the element should be treated as an image. Can be combined with button or link, for example.
- `'keyboardkey'` - Used when the element acts as a keyboard key.
- `'text'` - Used when the element should be treated as static text that cannot change.
- `'adjustable'` - Used when an element can be "adjusted" (e.g. a slider).
- `'imagebutton'` - Used when the element should be treated as a button and is also an image.
- `'header'` - Used when an element acts as a header for a content section (e.g. the title of a navigation bar).
- `'summary'` - Used when an element can be used to provide a quick summary of current conditions in the app when the app first launches.
- `'alert'` - Used when an element contains important text to be presented to the user.
- `'checkbox'` - Used when an element represents a checkbox which can be checked, unchecked, or have mixed checked state.
- `'combobox'` - Used when an element represents a combo box, which allows the user to select among several choices.
- `'menu'` - Used when the component is a menu of choices.
- `'menubar'` - Used when a component is a container of multiple menus.
- `'menuitem'` - Used to represent an item within a menu.
- `'progressbar'` - Used to represent a component which indicates progress of a task.
- `'radio'` - Used to represent a radio button.
- `'radiogroup'` - Used to represent a group of radio buttons.
- `'scrollbar'` - Used to represent a scroll bar.
- `'spinbutton'` - Used to represent a button which opens a list of choices.
- `'switch'` - Used to represent a switch which can be turned on and off.
- `'tab'` - Used to represent a tab.
- `'tablist'` - Used to represent a list of tabs.
- `'timer'` - Used to represent a timer.

### `accessible`

When `true`, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.

---

### `aria-busy`

Indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

---

### `aria-checked`

Indicates the state of a checkable element. This field can either take a boolean or the "mixed" string to represent mixed checkboxes.

| Type             | Default |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| boolean, 'mixed' | false   |

---

### `aria-disabled`

Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

---

### `aria-expanded`

Indicates whether an expandable element is currently expanded or collapsed.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

---

### `aria-hidden`

Indicates whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element are hidden.

For example, in a window that contains sibling views `A` and `B`, setting `aria-hidden` to `true` on view `B` causes VoiceOver to ignore the elements in the view `B`.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

---

### `aria-label`

Defines a string value that labels an interactive element.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `aria-selected`

Indicates whether a selectable element is currently selected or not.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

### `aria-valuemax`

Represents the maximum value for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars. Has precedence over the `max` value in the `accessibilityValue` prop.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

### `aria-valuemin`

Represents the minimum value for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars. Has precedence over the `min` value in the `accessibilityValue` prop.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

### `aria-valuenow`

Represents the current value for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars. Has precedence over the `now` value in the `accessibilityValue` prop.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

### `aria-valuetext`

Represents the textual description of the component. Has precedence over the `text` value in the `accessibilityValue` prop.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `collapsable`

Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to `false` to disable this optimization and ensure that this `View` exists in the native view hierarchy.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | true    |

---

### `collapsableChildren`

Setting to false prevents direct children of the view from being removed from the native view hierarchy, similar to the effect of setting `collapsable={false}` on each child.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | true    |

---

### `hitSlop`

This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view. Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels.

For example, if a touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with `hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}`

> The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

| Type                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| object: `{top: number, left: number, bottom: number, right: number}` |

---

### `id`

Used to locate this view from native classes. Has precedence over `nativeID` prop.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `nativeID`

Used to locate this view from native classes.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`

Whether this `View` needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (`false`) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the `View` you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping `View`s, or text and a background).

Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view **contents** are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => boolean` |

---

### `pointerEvents`

Controls whether the `View` can be the target of touch events.

- `'auto'`: The View can be the target of touch events.
- `'none'`: The View is never the target of touch events.
- `'box-none'`: The View is never the target of touch events but its subviews can be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

```css
.box-none {
  pointer-events: none;
}
.box-none * {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

- `'box-only'`: The view can be the target of touch events but its subviews cannot be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

```css
.box-only {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
.box-only * {
  pointer-events: none;
}

---

### `removeClippedSubviews`

This is a reserved performance property exposed by `RCTView` and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound. The subviews must also have `overflow: hidden`, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).

| ------------------------------ |
| [View Style](view-style-props) |

---

### `testID`

Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |
