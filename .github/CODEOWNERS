
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.

# This list of owners indicates who will be NOTIFIED when a PR changes a
# matched file. Please keep these rules in sync with the rules in
# .github/required-reviewers.yaml, which requires that ALL owners actually
# approve a PR.

# All entries should end in '@microsoft/react-native-windows-write' as it
# encourages everyone with write access be notified of PRs.
