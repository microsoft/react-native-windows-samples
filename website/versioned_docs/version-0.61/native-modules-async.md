A common scenario for [Native Modules](native-modules.md) is to call one or more native asynchronous methods from a JS asynchronous method. However it may not be immediately obvious how to properly bridge both asynchronous worlds, which can lead to unstable, difficult to debug code.

This document proposes some best patterns to follow when bridging asynchronous methods from JS to native code for React Native Windows. It assumes you've already familiar with the basics of setting up and writing [Native Modules](native-modules.md).

> The complete source for the examples below are provided within the [Native Module Sample in `microsoft/react-native-windows-samples`](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows-samples/tree/main/samples-old/NativeModuleSample).

## Writing Native Modules that call Asynchronous Windows APIs

Let's write a native module which uses asynchronous Windows APIs to perform a simple HTTP request. We'll call it `SimpleHttpModule` and it needs a single, promise-based method named `GetHttpResponse` that takes a URI string as a parameter and on success returns an object with both the HTTP status code and text content.

In the end, we'll want to call the method from JS as follows:

```js
NativeModules.SimpleHttpModule.GetHttpResponse('https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/')
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### `SimpleHttpModule` in C#

Let's start with the asynchronous native method which performs the HTTP request:

```csharp
static async Task GetHttpResponseAsync(string uri)
{
  // Create an HttpClient object
  var httpClient = new HttpClient();

  // Send the GET request asynchronously
  var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync(new Uri(uri));

  var statusCode = httpResponseMessage.StatusCode;
  var content = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

  // TODO: How to return the result?
}
```

The `GetHttpResponseAsync` method is pretty straight-forward at this point, it takes a `string` URI and "returns" a `Task` (which is to say, the method is asynchronous and doesn't actually return a value when it's done).

> If you're not familiar with writing asynchronous C# code, see [Call asynchronous APIs in C# or Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/threading-async/call-asynchronous-apis-in-csharp-or-visual-basic).

Inside `GetHttpResponseAsync`, we see it:
1. Creates a `HttpClient`.
2. Asynchronous calls the `GetAsync` method to make an HTTP request for the URI.
3. Parses the status code out of the returned `HttpResponseMessage` object.
4. Asynchronously parses the content out of the returned `HttpResponseMessage` object.

Now we have `statusCode` and `content`, but what do we do with it? How do we call this method from JS, and how do we get the result back to the JS?

Let's pause this and start building our native module:

```csharp
namespace NativeModuleSample
{
  [ReactModule]
  class SimpleHttpModule
  {
    [ReactMethod]
    public void GetHttpResponse(string uri, ReactPromise<JSValue> promise)
    {
    }
  }
}
```

Here we simply define `SimpleHttpModule` with an empty `GetHttpResponse` method.

Notice the method itself is `void` and that the last parameter in the signature is of type `ReactPromise<JSValue>`. This indicates to React Native Windows that we want a promise-based method in JS, and that the expected return value of a success is of type `JSValue`.

> **Note:** Using `JSValue` here is a workaround - we actually want to return a `JSValueObject` but using `ReactPromise<JSValueObject>` in C# will cause a runtime crash [#5617](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/5617). Functionally we can still resolve a `ReactPromise<JSValue>` with a `JSValueObject`.

All method parameters before this final promise are the input parameters we expect to be marshaled in from the JS. In this case, we want a single string for the URI to request.

The `promise` object is our interface for handling the promise and marshaling a result to the JS. To do so we simply call `promise.Resolve()` with the result object (if the operation was a success) or `promise.Reject()` with an error (if the operation failed).

Now that we know how to return results, let's prep `GetHttpResponseAsync` to take in a `ReactPromise<JSValue>` parameter and use it:

```csharp
static async Task GetHttpResponseAsync(string uri, ReactPromise<JSValue> promise)
{
  // Create an HttpClient object
  var httpClient = new HttpClient();

  // Send the GET request asynchronously
  var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync(new Uri(uri));

  var statusCode = httpResponseMessage.StatusCode;
  var content = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

  // Build result object
  var resultObject = new JSValueObject();

  resultObject["statusCode"] = (int)statusCode;
  resultObject["content"] = content;

  promise.Resolve(resultObject);
}
```

At the bottom of the method, we simply build the result object to be returned to JS, and pass it to `promise.Resolve()`. That's it for `GetHttpResponseAsync` - if the method execution gets to the end without any problems, it will resolve the promise, which marshals the result back to the JS.

Now that `GetHttpResponseAsync` is taken care of, let's bridge the gap between it and our new `GetHttpResponse` native module method.

```csharp
[ReactMethod]
public void GetHttpResponse(string uri, ReactPromise<JSValue> promise)
{
  var task = GetHttpResponseAsync(uri, promise);
}
```

Looks simple enough, right? We call `GetHttpResponseAsync` with the `uri` and `promise` parameters, and get back an `Task` object which we store in `task`. When this executes, `GetHttpResponseAsync` will return control when it hits its first `await`, which in turn will return control for the JS code to continue running. When everything in `GetHttpResponseAsync` succeeds, it itself is responsible for resolving the promise with the result.

But wait, what happens if `GetHttpResponseAsync` doesn't succeed? We don't handle any exceptions in this example, so if an exception is thrown, how do we marshal an error back to the JS? We have one more thing to do, and that's to check for unhandled exceptions:

```csharp
[ReactMethod]
public void GetHttpResponse(string uri, ReactPromise<JSValue> promise)
{
  var task = GetHttpResponseAsync(uri, promise);
  task.AsAsyncAction().Completed = (action, status) =>
  {
    if (status == AsyncStatus.Error)
    {
      var error = new ReactError();
      error.Exception = action.ErrorCode;
      promise.Reject(error);
    }
  };
}
```

We've defined an `AsyncActionCompletedHandler` lambda and set it to be run when `task` completes. Here we check if the action failed (i.e. `status == AsyncStatus.Error`) and if so, we build a `ReactError` object containing the unhandled exception. Then we pass that error to `promise.Reject()`, thereby marshaling the error back to the JS.

> **Important:** This example shows the minimum case, where you don't handle any errors within `GetHttpResponseAsync`, but you're not limited to this. You're free to detect error conditions within your code and call `promise.Reject()` yourself with (more useful) error messages at any time. However you should *always* include this final handler, to catch any unexpected and unhandled exceptions that may occur, especially when calling Windows APIs. Just be sure that you only call `Reject()` once and that nothing executes afterwards.

That's it! If you want to see the complete `SimpleHttpModule`, see [`AsyncMethodExamples.cs`](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows-samples/blob/main/samples-old/NativeModuleSample/csharp/windows/NativeModuleSample/AsyncMethodExamples.cs).

### `SimpleHttpModule` in C++/WinRT

Let's start with the asynchronous native method which performs the HTTP request:

```cpp
static winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncAction GetHttpResponseAsync(std::wstring uri) noexcept
{
  // Create an HttpClient object
  auto httpClient = winrt::Windows::Web::Http::HttpClient();

  // Send the GET request asynchronously
  auto httpResponseMessage = co_await httpClient.GetAsync(winrt::Windows::Foundation::Uri(uri));

  // Parse response
  auto statusCode = httpResponseMessage.StatusCode();
  auto content = co_await httpResponseMessage.Content().ReadAsStringAsync();

  // TODO: How to return the result?
}
```

The `GetHttpResponseAsync` method is pretty straight-forward at this point, it takes a `wstring` URI and "returns" an `IAsyncAction` (which is to say, the method is asynchronous and doesn't actually return a value when it's done).

> If you're not familiar with writing asynchronous C++/WinRT code, see [Concurrency and asynchronous operations with C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/concurrency).

Inside `GetHttpResponseAsync`, we see it:
1. Creates a `HttpClient`.
2. Asynchronous calls the `GetAsync` method to make an HTTP request for the URI.
3. Parses the status code out of the returned `HttpResponseMessage` object.
4. Asynchronously parses the content out of the returned `HttpResponseMessage` object.

Now we have `statusCode` and `content`, but what do we do with it? How do we call this method from JS, and how do we get the result back to the JS?

Let's pause this and start building our native module:

```cpp
namespace NativeModuleSample
{
  REACT_MODULE(SimpleHttpModule);
  struct SimpleHttpModule
  {
    REACT_METHOD(GetHttpResponse);
    void GetHttpResponse(std::wstring uri,
        winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::ReactPromise<winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::JSValueObject> promise) noexcept
    {
    }
  };
}
```

Here we simply define `SimpleHttpModule` with an empty `GetHttpResponse` method.

Notice the method itself is `void` and that the last parameter in the signature is of type `ReactPromise<JSValueObject>`. This indicates to React Native Windows that we want a promise-based method in JS, and that the expected return value of a success is of type `JSValueObject`.

All method parameters before this final promise are the input parameters we expect to be marshaled in from the JS. In this case, we want a single string for the URI to request.

The `promise` object is our interface for handling the promise and marshaling a result to the JS. To do so we simply call `promise.Resolve()` with the result object (if the operation was a success) or `promise.Reject()` with an error (if the operation failed).

Now that we know how to return results, let's prep `GetHttpResponseAsync` to take in a `ReactPromise<JSValueObject>` parameter and use it:

```cpp
static winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncAction GetHttpResponseAsync(std::wstring uri,
  winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::ReactPromise<winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::JSValueObject> promise) noexcept
{
  auto capturedPromise = promise;
  
  // Create an HttpClient object
  auto httpClient = winrt::Windows::Web::Http::HttpClient();

  // Send the GET request asynchronously
  auto httpResponseMessage = co_await httpClient.GetAsync(winrt::Windows::Foundation::Uri(uri));

  // Parse response
  auto statusCode = httpResponseMessage.StatusCode();
  auto content = co_await httpResponseMessage.Content().ReadAsStringAsync();

  // Build result object
  auto resultObject = winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::JSValueObject();

  resultObject["statusCode"] = static_cast<int>(statusCode);
  resultObject["content"] = winrt::to_string(content);

  capturedPromise.Resolve(resultObject);
}
```

What have we done here? First off, we've "captured" the `promise` locally within the asynchronous method by copying it into `capturedPromise`. We do this because this is an asynchronous method calling other asynchronous methods, and otherwise we risk the `ReactPromise` object getting deleted prematurely by React Native Windows.

> **Important:** Our only input parameter in this example is a `wstring`, but if your method uses `JSValue`, `JSValueArray`, or `JSValueObject` parameter types, you'll need to "capture" those with a copy too. Example:
> ```cpp
> static winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncAction MethodAsync(winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::JSValueObject options) noexcept
> {
>   auto captureOptions = options.Copy();
>   ...
> }
> ```

At the bottom of the method, we simply build the result object to be returned to JS, and pass it to `capturedPromise.Resolve()`. That's it for `GetHttpResponseAsync` - if the method execution gets to the end without any problems, it will resolve the promise, which marshals the result back to the JS.

Now that `GetHttpResponseAsync` is taken care of, let's bridge the gap between it and our new `GetHttpResponse` native module method.

```cpp
REACT_METHOD(GetHttpResponse);
void GetHttpResponse(std::wstring uri,
    winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::ReactPromise<winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::JSValueObject> promise) noexcept
{
  auto asyncOp = GetHttpResponseAsync(uri, promise);
}
```

Looks simple enough, right? We call `GetHttpResponseAsync` with the `uri` and `promise` parameters, and get back an `IAsyncAction` object which we store in `asyncOp`. When this executes, `GetHttpResponseAsync` will return control when it hits its first `co_await`, which in turn will return control for the JS code to continue running. When everything in `GetHttpResponseAsync` succeeds, it itself is responsible for resolving the promise with the result.

But wait, what happens if `GetHttpResponseAsync` doesn't succeed? We don't handle any exceptions in this example, so if an exception is thrown, how do we marshal an error back to the JS? We have one more thing to do, and that's to check for unhandled exceptions:

```cpp
REACT_METHOD(GetHttpResponse);
void GetHttpResponse(std::wstring uri,
    winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::ReactPromise<winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::JSValueObject> promise) noexcept
{
  auto asyncOp = GetHttpResponseAsync(uri, promise);
  asyncOp.Completed([promise](auto action, auto status)
  {
    if (status == winrt::Windows::Foundation::AsyncStatus::Error)
    {
      std::stringstream errorCode;
      errorCode << "0x" << std::hex << action.ErrorCode() << std::endl;

      auto error = winrt::Microsoft::ReactNative::ReactError();
      error.Message = "HRESULT " + errorCode.str() + ": " + std::system_category().message(action.ErrorCode());
      promise.Reject(error);
    }
  });
}
```

We've defined an `AsyncActionCompletedHandler` lambda and set it to be run when `asyncOp` completes. Here we check if the action failed (i.e. `status == AsyncStatus::Error`) and if so, we build a `ReactError` object where the message contains both the error code (a Windows `HRESULT`) and the error message for that code. Then we pass that error to `promise.Reject()`, thereby marshaling the error back to the JS.

> **Important:** This example shows the minimum case, where you don't handle any errors within `GetHttpResponseAsync`, but you're not limited to this. You're free to detect error conditions within your code and call `capturedPromise.Reject()` yourself with (more useful) error messages at any time. However you should *always* include this final handler, to catch any unexpected and unhandled exceptions that may occur, especially when calling Windows APIs. Just be sure that you only call `Reject()` once and that nothing executes afterwards.
