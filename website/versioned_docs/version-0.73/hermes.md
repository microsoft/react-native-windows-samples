# Hermes

The [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) engine is an open source JavaScript engine created by Facebook to optimize building and running React Native applications.

To learn more about what it is and how to use it, check out the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes#docsNav) documentation for it.

## Hermes on Windows:

Hermes is supported on Windows, generally providing better performance characteristics than the default Chakra engine.

### Enabling Hermes for new projects

Hermes is enabled by default for React Native Windows projects.

### Using Hermes in an existing project

Set the `UseHermes` property to `true` in the `ExperimentalFeatures.props` file in your project's `windows` directory:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Label="Microsoft.ReactNative Experimental Features">
  ...
  <UseHermes>true</UseHermes>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Disabling Hermes

To revert back to using Chakra, set the `UseHermes` property to `false` in the `ExperimentalFeatures.props` file in your project's `windows` directory:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Label="Microsoft.ReactNative Experimental Features">
  ...
  <UseHermes>false</UseHermes>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Known limitations

- Hermes dll is not signed by Microsoft.

## Hermes on macOS

Hermes is available on React Native for macOS, provided you are using version 0.62 or higher.
To learn how to upgrade to the latest version, check out the **Upgrading** section of the [macOS Getting Started guide](rnm-getting-started.md).

After you have upgraded to the latest version of React Native for macOS, install and add the following:

1. Install the npm package `yarn add 'hermes-engine-darwin@^0.4.3'`
2. Add (or uncomment) the following pod dependencies to your macOS target in your `Podfile`:<br>

```
pod 'React-Core/Hermes', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/'
pod 'hermes', :path => '../node_modules/hermes-engine-darwin'
pod 'libevent', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/third-party-podspecs/libevent.podspec'
```

3. Run `pod install`

> Be sure to set your target's deployment target to at least 10.14 before running `pod install`

## Hermes Inspector

_React Native for Windows_ with _Hermes engine_ supports direct JavaScript runtime inspection using tools such as Chrome or [Edge `devtools`](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/), [`VSCode` debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging), [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) etc. by implementing an in-process Chrome Debug Protocol server.
Please note that it is fundamentally different from "Remote JS Debugging", which loads the JavaScript bundle into a remote Chrome browser session with duplex communication over IPC channels.

We share the implementation (code and design) with other platforms wherever possible. All the external endpoints, APIs and protocols should be identical to _React Native_ environments on other platforms.
Hence, we expect most tooling available on other platforms to just work on Windows. But, as of now, we have tested only with Chrome and Edge `devtools`.

### Steps to enable direct debugging

1. Initialize React Native Host,
   - Turn on `DeveloperSupport`
   - Turn on `FastRefresh`
   - Turn off `WebDebugger`
   - Turn on `Direct Debugging`
2. Ensure Dev-Server is running
3. Start the application

After the app has booted,

4. Navigate to `edge://inspect` in Edge browser or `chrome://inspect` in Chrome browser
5. Enable **Discover network targets** and **configure** the target discovery settings to include `localhost:8081` (or wherever the metro server is running)
6. Within a few seconds "Hermes React Native" should appear on the page as a remote target
7. Click on the **inspect** link to launch the `devtools` page
8. Click `Ctrl+P` to open source files and set break points
9. Alternatively, you can insert `debugger` statements in source code to break on specific locations

In order to break on locations during boot, you can either

- Add statements into the boot sequence to pause the runtime waiting for debugger to connect.

```js
debugger;
```

- Set a break point and refresh the bundle through the Dev Server. The runtime will wait for debugger to attach.

### Steps to enable heap profiling

Follow steps 1-7 from above, and then

1. Click on the "Memory" tab in the inspector
2. Heap snapshots and instrumented allocations should be working.

### Enable debugging/profiling on release builds

We keep the inspector turned off on release builds by default. If you want to debug or profile release builds, set the MSBuild property `EnableHermesInspectorInReleaseFlavor` to `'true'` when building the platform.

```bash
npx react-native run-windows --msbuild EnableHermesInspectorInReleaseFlavor=true
```

### Known Issues

1. CPU Sampling profiler currently doesn't work.
