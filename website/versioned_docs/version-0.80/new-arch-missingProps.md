### `zIndex`

zIndex controls which components display on top of others. Normally, you don't use zIndex. Components render according to their order in the document tree, so later components draw over earlier ones. zIndex may be useful if you have animations or custom modal interfaces where you don't want this behavior.

It works like the CSS z-index property - components with a larger zIndex will render on top. Think of the z-direction like it's pointing from the phone into your eyeball. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index for more details.
