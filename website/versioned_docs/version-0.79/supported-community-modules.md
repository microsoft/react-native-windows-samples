## `ReactNative.Directory`

The [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/) lists libraries and native modules that are available across all of the React Native platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and more.

To view which modules are available for a specific platform, you can use the Filters function on the website, or visit these pre-filtered URLs:

- [Modules that support Windows](https://reactnative.directory/?windows=true)
- [Modules that support macOS](https://reactnative.directory/?macos=true)

## Help! A module I need doesn't work with Windows and/or macOS!

If you need a module that doesn't currently have a native Windows and/or macOS implementation, please file an issue on the module repository to let them know that you need Windows and/or macOS support.
