You can run React Native for Windows apps only on:

- All Windows 11 devices
- Windows 10 devices with Windows version: 10.0.16299.0 (aka 1709, aka Redstone 3, aka Fall Creators Update) or higher
  Some features may not work on all versions. See [Windows 10 Compatibility](win10-compat.md) for version support details.

To develop React-Native for Windows apps, you need to install several dependencies.

## Install the development dependencies
To check or install dependencies, run the script [`rnw-dependencies.ps1`](https://aka.ms/rnw-vs2019-deps.ps1) in an elevated PowerShell window.

**Run this command:**
Start an **elevated** PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force;
iex (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://aka.ms/rnw-vs2019-deps.ps1');

```

> The recommended way is to use the script above as the information in this manual section is likely to get out of date

Alternatively, you can setup your environment manually:
- Ensure Developer Mode is turned ON in Windows Settings App.
- It is _highly_ recommended to update the Windows system.
- Install a recent version of [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads) **with the following options checked**:
  - **Workloads**
    - Node.js development, or one of the following alternatives:
      - Install from **Individual Components**:
        - Development activities
          - Node.js development support
      - Install Node.js separately, see below for some options
    - .NET Desktop development
    - Desktop development with C++
    - Universal Windows Platform development
      - Include `C++ (v142) Universal Windows Platform tools` (under 'Optional')
      - Older Windows 10 SDK version may be needed at this point.
- Ensure that long path support is enabled.

Options to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) separately:
  - Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (_React Native recommended_). To use chocolatey, from an elevated Command Prompt, run:
  ```bat
  choco install nodejs-lts
  ```
  - Using [another package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) such as [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [Node Version Switcher (nvs)](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs)
  - Directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Optional steps that are _highly recommended_:

- Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (needed for JS debugging)
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (**required** to contribute to react-native-windows)
- Install `git` using a method such as:
  - Using a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
  - Install [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
  - Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Troubleshooting

- If after running the app, the packager does not update (or) app does not show React Native content - close the packager command prompt window and the app, make sure browser is open, run `yarn start` and run the app from Visual Studio again.
- If you get a red error box in your UWP app window with the error message : `ERROR: Instance failed to start. A connection with the server cannot be established`, make sure you have the packager running using `yarn start` and run the app again.
