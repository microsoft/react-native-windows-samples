This guide will give you more information on the `autolink-windows` command of the React Native Windows CLI.

## `autolink-windows`

The `autolink-windows` CLI command is used to link the native code and build systems for a React Native for Windows app with any native community modules it uses.

**Note:** Autolinking runs automatically as part of running the [run-windows command](run-windows-cli.md), unless the `--no-autolink` argument is used.

### Usage
Runs Windows-specific autolinking for your RNW project.
  
```bat
npx react-native autolink-windows
```
