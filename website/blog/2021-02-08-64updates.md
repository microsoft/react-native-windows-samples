React Native 0.64 is out! Which means it's time to showcase all the work we've put in around supporting more community modules, TurboModules, APIs improvements, and even some tools, all in the effort to improve the developer experience.

<!--truncate-->

There's been a lot of work on improving the developer experience, as that's been a focus for us as a whole across all our frameworks and platforms, and React Native for Windows is no exception! Through tooling, dogfooding our own work, and "under the hood" improvements, we're looking forward to sharing with you some of the highlights in this release that we're especially proud to announce.

# 📣 React Native Gallery App
As part of our growing effort to improve the APIs, developer experience, and end-to-end story of developing React Native apps for Windows, we've decided to build and ship our own app, called the [React Native Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery).

The app's main purpose is to showcase all the current functionality available in React Native for Windows, while also being a way for us to test cross-platform community modules and keep ourselves honest about the process of pushing an app to the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/windows).

Much like the [XAML Controls Gallery](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt) for WinUI, we intend to have the React Native Gallery be available not only as a proving ground for our own work, but also a place where native and JavaScript components alike can be seen in action in the Windows ecosystem. This includes providing lightweight code snippets on each page for developers to copy out and use in their own scenarios.

## 🧪 Try it out now!
To get your hands on a copy of the app while we wait for final Store approval, head on over to the repo and check out the [certified install on our 0.64 branch](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery/tree/v0.64.0-preview.5/windows/rngallery_1.0.2.0_Win32_Test).

Alternately, you can get the latest state of the app and the source to test things out directly on our [main repo branch](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery).

# ✨ Developer Goodness
As with many of our releases, there's always a number of developer and "under the covers" upgrades we make to the framework as a whole. These usually includes things like performance improvements, better API parity and of course general bug fixes, but let's take a look at some of the notable items available this release.

## 🎉 API parity highlights

More component properties supported by the other platforms now work on Windows! Check them out.

### ⚙ `Platform.version`
The core API `Platform` has now been extended to include Windows. This means you can improve your styles and refine your Windows app experience.

``` js
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,    
    ...Platform.select({
      Windows: {
        backgroundColor: 'blue'
      },
      default: {
        // fallback for other/unspecified platforms
        backgroundColor: 'grey'
      }
    })
  }
});
```

### ⚙ More `Text` properties
The `Text` component properties `backgroundColor`, `border`, and `textTransform` are now available on Windows and apply to our native text controls as you'd expect.

- **backgroundColor** will set the backfill/plate color behind your text.
- **border** encompasses all the border functionalities, like borderWidth, borderColor, etc.
- **textTransform** can force all strings lowercase, uppercase, or capitalization depending.

```js
import React from "react";
import { Text, StyleSheet } from "react-native";

const TextTest = () => {
  return (
    <Text style={styles.newTextProperties}>
      some text goes here
    </Text>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  newTextProperties: {
    color: "white",
    backgroundColor: "blue",
    borderColor: "black",
    borderWidth: 1,
    textTransform: "capitalize"
  }
});

export default TextTest;
```

### ⚙ `AccessibilityInfo`
We've begun improving the JavaScript and native control accessibility experiences by hooking up some initial behavior for these scenarios.

- [**isReduceMotionEnabled**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#isreducemotionenabled) returns true or false depending on whether the user of the device has specified they need less motion sensitivity - *full implementation*.
- [**announceForAccessibility**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#announceforaccessibility) tires to find an element on the current screen to raise the event from - *partial implementation*.
- **isTouchExplorationEnabled** will return a boolean indicating whether or now the user has a screen narrator or similar running. This feature needs more testing, but is available in an alpha state for you to use - *partial implementation*.

## 🎇 Expanded documentation
We've added a lot to our documentation too, both within the Native APIs and on other important developer topics like virtual machines and picking which C language you want your React Native app to be compiled in.

### 🔧🔨 Choice between C++ or C# compiled apps
A big request for our documentation has been steps on how to set up an app for wither C++ or C# development, and we're happy to announce that we've [put together all the info necessary](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/native-code-language-choice) to get started with either.

### 📡 Develop for Windows on anything
If you have either a local or Azure virtual machine set up, you can develop Windows app on a non-Windows PC.

Grab the VM of your choice from the [Windows 10 development environment](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/). Once you have that virtual environment up and running, set up that new VM [set up for React Native for Windows development](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/rnw-dependencies) just as you would today and deploy your builds to it.

Check out the [full documentation on the process here](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/win10-vm).

### 💻 Native Windows APIs
We've even added a reference sheet so you can take a look at the native API's that are available under the [`Microsoft.ReactNative`](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/Native-API-Reference) namespace, like:

- [Enums](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/Native-API-Reference#enums)
- [Interfaces](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/Native-API-Reference#interfaces)
- [Structs](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/Native-API-Reference#structs)
- [Classes](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/Native-API-Reference#classes)
- [Delegates](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/Native-API-Reference#delegates)

Curious about how to work with native code using a React Native for Windows app? [We've got you covered for that too!](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/native-code)

## 🚀 TurboModules

We've added support for C++ JSI TurboModules as they exist today in React Native core projects. You won't have to worry about writing any code differently from how you do today in React Native, but when you run your app on Windows, we will ensure it works over the ABI-safe boundaries. This means your React Native Windows TurboModules can be shipped in different DLLs and we take care of the binary compatibility between versions.

This feature is still considered experimental in 0.64, because it is not finished in React Native Core. Meaning we may need to change the ABI surface in future releases.

## 🎯 Easy opt-in to Hermes

Performance is a huge deal when developing in general, but especially so when it comes to using React Native. We're pretty invested is using Hermes and while there are teams using it in production, support is still experimental and we do not have the full Hermes debugger or Hermes in C# capabilities online yet. We would still love to know if you try Hermes and run into any issues, so go ahead and [give it a try today!]((https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/hermes))

## 🎁 Get the goodness
The best way to upgrade from 0.62 or 0.63 to this latest **0.64** release is to:
- Create a brand new blank 0.64 using `react-native-windows-init`
- Copy over the content of your older versions project

Moving forward we are looking to provide a diff tool to help make this easier, this tool would operate similarly to `react-native-upgrade-helper`.

# 📚 Growing Windows community module support

Over the last couple of months, the team has made a concerted effort to increase the number of modules that target React Native for Windows. We know that modules are an important part of React Native ecosystem, so we are excited to share that we’ve added Windows implementations for several modules, including:

- [react-native-tts](https://github.com/ak1394/react-native-tts)
- [react-native-codepush](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push)
- [react-native-sketch-canvas](https://github.com/creambyemute/react-native-sketch-canvas)
- [react-native-pdf](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf)
- [react-native-print](https://github.com/christopherdro/react-native-print)
- [react-native-device-info](https://github.com/react-native-device-info/react-native-device-info)
- [react-native-orientation-locker](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-orientation-locker)
- [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob) ([module unmaintained](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob/issues/666), but [Windows code in PR](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob/pull/701))
- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) ([in PR](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen/pull/514))

… and more are coming! You can see which modules we’re tracking on the [Community Module Requests project board.](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/23)

In addition to the modules that we have recently worked on, you can view and search the complete list of modules that work with Windows by visiting [reactnative.directory](https://reactnative.directory/). The directory catalogues modules that work on the major platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS and provides metrics around usage, popularity, and more.

You can also check out the [react-native-gallery repo](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery) to see some of the modules “in action”. We’re using the Gallery as a testbed to verify and showcase modules that work with Windows – we’re adding new samples over time, so check back often!

## 🚧 A module I need doesn't work with Windows yet!

Fret not! We’re continually reassessing and reviewing the set of modules that are important to React Native for Windows devs, so if you need a module that doesn’t yet have a Windows implementation, please [open a new issue on the React Native for Windows GitHub repo.](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new/choose)

If you have experience writing Windows native code, you can also use the [new Community module template workflow](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/native-modules-setup) to create a module template for Windows. This is a great way to start using native Windows APIs quickly in custom modules.
