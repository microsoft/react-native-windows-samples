# Native Module C# Sample - React Native for Windows

See main [../README.md](../README.md) for details of this sample.

See main [../cppwinrt/](../cppwinrt/) for a C++/WinRT version of this sample.

>**Note: Don't build your own projects directly out of this sample. When you publish a native module (as source), you'll want to create a new project with the correct metadata. This will also make sure that you're using unique identifiers in your project files to avoid conflicts with other native modules.**
