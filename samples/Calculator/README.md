# Calculator - React Native for Windows

This sample showcases the usage of React Native for Windows to build a simple calculator. It includes implementations in C# and C++/WinRT.

It currently targets React Native Windows 0.77.

### Setup
First, make sure you've met the [React Native Windows System Requirements](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnw-dependencies).

Then, within the csharp or cppwinrt folder, install the applications's dependencies. If you have `yarn` installed:

```cmd
yarn install
```

Otherwise, you can just use npm:

```cmd
npm install
```

### Run
Once you have all of the dependencies installed, you can run the application with the following command:

```cmd
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest run-windows
```

The command will:
* Build the application and all dependencies
* Deploy the application
* Launch the React Native Server and Debugger
* Launch the application

### Upgrade
To upgrade either sample to the latest version of RNW, see their individual readme file.
